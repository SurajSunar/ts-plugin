### About the Project

This repository serves as an experimental environment to deeply understand how plugin-driven architectures work. The goal is to explore how applications can be designed to be extensible, modular, and maintainable by allowing external components—plugins—to integrate seamlessly.  
It demonstrates the core principles behind plugin discovery, registration, execution, and lifecycle management, making it a useful reference for developers looking to build scalable systems that support customization without modifying the core application.
